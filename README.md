## Welcome on my GitHub homepage. 

### Who am I ?
I am an engineer in Network and Telecommunications. I have founded a startup and was its CTO for more than a year. I am passionate about cybersecurity. You can find some security oriented projects. As well as a lot of garbage projects.
But I'm also a certified first responder in the French Red-Cross rescue teams. So, you'll find some rescue and emergency management oriented projects.
